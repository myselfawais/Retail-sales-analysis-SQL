# Retail Sales Data Analysis Project

## üìä Project Overview
A comprehensive SQL data analysis project exploring a retail sales dataset. This project involves data cleaning, exploration, and solving over 20 business problems using advanced SQL queries to uncover insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends. The initial dataset and foundational queries were inspired by the YouTube channel Zero Analyst. I expanded on this by researching and solving additional advanced data exploration problems based on real-world business demands, all of which are detailed below.


## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **SQL** (PostgreSQL syntax)
- **Git** & **GitHub** for version control
- **Markdown** for documentation

## üìÅ Database Schema
The analysis is performed on a single table `retail_sales` with the following structure:

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `transactions_id` | INT | Unique identifier for each transaction (Primary Key) |
| `sale_date` | DATE | Date of the sale |
| `sale_time` | TIME | Time of the sale |
| `customer_id` | INT | Unique identifier for each customer |
| `gender` | VARCHAR(15) | Gender of the customer |
| `age` | INT | Age of the customer |
| `category` | VARCHAR(15) | Product category purchased |
| `quantity` | INT | Number of units sold |
| `price_per_unit` | FLOAT | Price per unit of the product |
| `cogs` | FLOAT | Cost of Goods Sold |
| `total_sale` | FLOAT | Total revenue (quantity * price_per_unit) |

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before running the SQL scripts, ensure you have:
- A relational database management system (RDBMS) installed (e.g., [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), MySQL).
- A database client tool (e.g., [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/), DBeaver, MySQL Workbench, I personally use pgAdmin $).

### Installation & Setup
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/retail-sales-sql-analysis.git
    cd retail-sales-sql-analysis
    ```

2.  **Set up the database:**
    - Create a new database in your RDBMS (e.g., named `retail_sales`).
    - Run the `CREATE TABLE` statement found in the `scripts/retail_sales_analysis.sql` file to create the table structure.

3.  **Import the data:**
    - Use the import function of your database client (e.g., pgAdmin's Import/Export wizard) to load the `data/retail_sales_data.csv` file into the `retail_sales` table.

4.  **Run the queries:**
    - Open the `scripts/retail_sales_analysis.sql` file in your database client.
    - Execute the queries sequentially to see the results.

## üìà Analysis Highlights
The SQL script contains queries to solve business problems across three difficulty levels:

### Beginner
- Total sales by product category.
- Filtering transactions by date, category, and quantity.
- Customer demographic analysis.

### Intermediate
- Daily and hourly sales trends.
- Identifying top customers by revenue.
- Monthly sales growth rate (MoM analysis).
- Profitability analysis by category.

### Advanced
- **Cohort Analysis** to measure customer retention.
- Month-over-Monnth (MoM) growth comparison.
- Market basket analysis (Frequently Bought Together).

## üìä Key Insights
- The top-selling product category was `Electronics`, contributing over 30% of total revenue.
- Sales peak between 6 PM and 9 PM, suggesting optimal times for staffing and promotions.
